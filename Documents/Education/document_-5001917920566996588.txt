Abstract  
 
This article presents research  findings of the vocational teachers’ experience in reimagining the role of  
innovative technologies based on the professional development course ‘ Digital Education for Teachers ’ 
which was held in vocational education institutions of Tyumen Region. The main challenge of the course 
was to help the teachers develop and integrate their digital competence in vocational ed ucation, allowing 
them to create electronic educational resources for action oriented activities and work -based learning by 
combining digital educational materials and learning opportunities for online interaction with 
conventional methods.  The teachers we re introduced to the use of blended learning models, which enable 
them to create learning content and impart it choosing appropriate media for a specific learning program.  
Over the course of eight months the teachers created 490 electronic educational reso urces for specific 
learning programs and incorporated them into the curriculum content. A total number of 140 teachers have produced digital learning materials for 93 disciplines and tested them in the educational environment 
whereby enlarging the curricul um scope.  Digital education for teachers expands the role of educators and 
largely contributes to a gradual transition from traditional forms of interaction with students to electronic 
educational resources  (EER) designed for  tailoring instruction to individuals' needs and skills for students 
to become self -directed learners .

 211 1. Introduction 
Continuous modernization of the education system allows us to identify those trends that change 
the approach to pedagogy and education, with digitalization  coming to the fore. Digitalization not merely 
makes  the education process more flexible, or more adjusted to the realities of the modern day, but also 
leads to the influx of competitive professionals in the changing digital world.  
The digitalization of professional education is caused by the need to evolve  the vocational 
education and training  to reach the milestones  of the modern world. Digital economy  and digital 
education are defined as Russia’s top priority  reflected in the federal acts . From a policy standpoint, the 
factors that give rise to the need to build a digital educational process for vocational education and 
training are the three trends that characterize the formation of a digital society:  
 
 digital economy and new requirements for the employees;  
 new digital information technologies that shape and promote the digital environment;  
 digital generation, i.e., a new generation of learners  with specific sociopsychological  traits.  
 
The digitalization of vocational education results in rethinking the status of the teacher who 
assumes a lea dership role and acts as a leader capable of teaching,  guiding, instructing and educating 
students  using modern electronic educational technologies, digital learning content and other resources.  A 
leader's position in promoting effective educational resources is stipulated by : 
 
 a teacher’s willingness to learn how to increase educator -specific digital competences ; 
 a students’ trust, i.e., the teacher acts as a digital expert in the teaching –learning process ; 
 the successful incorporation of electronic content  is guaranteed by a certain mindset when the 
teacher effectively  adapts the newly acquired technologies to the students’ needs . 
 
Building trust between the teacher and the students is difficult, but it starts with virtual empathy. 
Emotion al dimension in digital literacy has gained scholarly attention. Previous research on digital 
competence (Ala- Mutka, 2011; Are a & Pessoa, 2012 ; Eshet -Alkalai, 2004 ) has shown that emotional 
skills are needed for the development of digital literacy in the 2 1st century. According to Ala -Mutka  
(2010) , emotional dimension is emerging as a significant area of digital competence, – emotional skills 
are critical for promoting intercultural communication and collaboration in informal learning on social 
networks. Es het-Alkalai (2004) also emphasizes  the importance of socio- emotional dimension of digital 
literacy, which encompasses cognitive and metacognitive aspects together with the affective one s. García -
Pérez  et al.  (2016) argue that empathy has not been studied within the educational context created by new 
virtual surroundings. Røkenes and Krumsvik (2014) highlight  that digital competence requires both 
cognitive and emot ional skills to function effectively in the digital environm ent. The leading role of 
critical thinking skills underlying digital competency is acknowledged by Instefjord  and Munthe  (2017)  
who describe  the critical and reflective as pects of building new knowledge .

 212 2. Problem Statement  
The critical  requirements for the Russian Federal State Educational Standard for the vocational 
education curricula  serve to  stimulate teachers to search for electronic educational resources that meet 
didactic objectives concurrently updating the learning content. Ther efore, teachers are to be trained to sort 
out the  educational resources available online as well as to see the possibilities of their use in training 
sessions. Digital  training for vocational education teachers encourages them to create electronic 
educatio nal resources appropriate for the changing educational environment.  
The main challenge of vocational education is to teach problem -solving skills and practical 
competence. Most professional competencies are formed through practical work or work -based 
experiences such as internships, job shadows  and apprenticeships. Therefore, combining theoretical and 
practical knowledge is a paramount task  (Volkodav, 2015) . Theoretical training is carried out through 
educational and methodological support for the students to study academic disciplines at  their own pace 
using  digital technologies.  
Teacher professional development is regarded as an important  approach for the improvement of 
quality of teaching  (Thurlings  & Perry den Brok, 2017). The professional development co urse is designed 
to prepare and support teachers as e- teachers, rather than teachers who sporadically  resort to  Internet 
resources and digital devices for instruction. The professional development courses tend to focus on new 
paradigms  of technological integration, collaboration, teaching and learning (Rice & Deschaine, 2020).  
Electronic educational resource is a set of teaching tools that includes structure, subject content 
and metadata about them. Electronic educational resource represents a kind of digital shell, filled with the 
content created by the teacher (Semenovskikh, 2014). Electronic educational resources can be classified 
according to the four criteria: (1) mission; (2) character; (3) technology; (4) functions (Ibragimova &  
Skobeleva, 2017; Kucher, 2017; Zakieva, 2018 ). Modern educational system relies on orthodox face -to-
face instruction an d digital learning, which is based on electronic resources  and didactic methodology. 
This combination of various technologies is  subsequently  synthesized into blended learning (Vasiliev  et 
al., 2014).  
Blended learning is not only redesigning the current education landscape, redefining the standards 
for teaching and learning, it is placing ‘a strong emphasis on work -based learning’ (Semenovskikh, 2015). 
The application of blended learning (Shlyapina, 2016) in academic context is meant to help vocational 
education teachers: (a) to enhance the educational opportunities for students by offering more flexible and 
permeable learning pathways; (b) to tailor learning to each student’s needs by providing different 
potential pathways to learning while monitoring the pace at which students move forward through the 
learning materials; (c) to encourage and stimulate students to be independent self -directed learners 
through the use of electronic resources; (d) to move away from knowledge transfer to interactive knowledge sharing, for instance, by creating joint online presentations with Prezi; (e) to assume the role 
of a mentor and a digital expert; (f) to build a new information environment and a highly -effective 
learning environment; (g) to reduce accessibility barriers and enhance  the quality of education.

 213 3. Research Questions  
In the modern society, such trends as digitalization  and gadgetization  are influencing almost all 
the spheres of life, including education where new technologies are reshaping the educational process by 
enhancing the teacher’s role in the classro om. Firstly, when it comes to digital technologies, the 
pedagogical community shows a certain degree of conservatism. Secondly, educators, including interns 
and teacher trainees, lack those competencies that involve the skills to effectively operate modern 
technologies in order to solve pedagogical problems.  Targeted digital learning for teachers empowers 
educators to develop and effectively imbed the electronic educational resources needed in today's 
changing education paradigm, which  requires teacher educators to constantly review  professional learning  
opportunities , responding to rapidly changing educational environments affected  by emerging digital 
technolog ies (Falloon, 2020).  
3.1. Are educators ready to take the responsibility for ensur ing the quality of the new media 
education?  
3.2. What prevents them from taking a leadership position in promoting effective pedagogical 
technologies?  
3.3. Can teachers be trained to review and modernize their learning content and reconsider how best 
to engage and i nspire their learners?  
 
4. Purpose of the Study  
We aimed at  establish ing a pattern between an increasingly active integration  of electronic 
resources in to education  underlying  the teachers' digital competencies and the students' redistribution of 
classroom hours enabling them to study the theory of the subject while enhancing their practical skills.  
The professional development course ‘Digital Education for Teachers’ was launched to focus  on 
improving the teachers’ digital competencies by means of personalized learning and educational modules. 
 
5. Research Methods  
In the current study, the research method of content analysis  was applied to analyze and measure 
the teachers' work on Moodle. The units of analysis included 490 electronic educational resources for 
various learning programs  created by the vocational education teachers. Along with formal analysis , 
which is characterized by a lesser degree of subjectivity, content analysis  encompassed  quantitative 
analysis  to obtain higher accuracy when comparing the first order statistic. Additionally, to achieve the 
mission  of the research, the teachers were exposed to blended learning models.

 214 6. Findings  
Teachers are gradually becoming involved in designing and scaling up  electronic resources  in 
teaching practice. Electronic educational resources encourage teachers to constantly revise the dimensions 
of teaching by empowering the students to self -manage. Therefore , it has become increasingly important 
for vocational educat ion teachers to increase their digital competence. Vocational teachers are 
strengthening the necessary skills to select electronic educational resources in accordance with the 
educational objectives, to tailor learning to each student’s needs, and to measure their effectiveness, for 
example, in assessing student performance.  
The professional development course ‘Digital Education for Teachers ’ was held from November 
2018 to June 2019 in vocational education institutions of Tyumen Region. The course modules w ere 
aimed at instructing the teachers on how to incorporate evidence -based practices into real- world settings 
through designing and testing the electronic educational resources. The main idea behind the course was 
to develop and integrate teachers’ digital  competence in vocational education, allowing the teachers to 
create electronic educational resources for action oriented activities , work -based learning and blended 
learning models  by combining digital content and opportunities for virtual interaction with conventional 
place- based classroom methods. The course program was designed to support the teachers in their efforts 
to structurize  their programs with an emphasis on digital  learning .  
During the implementation phase of the professional development c ourse,  there was a solid 
emphasis on instructing vocational education teachers on how to develop learning content using 
shareware software, free programs, open- source  platforms, etc.  E-learning content à la carte is changing 
the face of traditional education, by offering individual productions of digital learning resources for transmitting knowledge and skills, thereby increasing student mobility and academic achievement. The 
teachers were introduced to the use of blended learning models, which enable them to create learning 
content and impart it choosing appropriate media for a specific learning program.  
The framework guiding teacher digital capability development  builds on the following elements 
(shown in Figure 01): 
 
 An introduction to blended learning;  
 Presentation services;  
 Assessment services;  
 Infographic makers;  
 Animation services.

 The structure of the training courses  
 
The professional development course ‘Digital Education for Teachers ’ encouraged the teachers to 
consider an  expanded view of teacher digital competence in vocational education. Over the course of 
eight months the teachers  created 490 electronic educational resources for specific learning programs  
including  123 interactive presentations with Prezi,  135 assessment tools with  Onlin e Test Pad, 122 
Piktochart  infographics and 110 animated videos on Powtoon.com.  Thus, they encompassed all the 
aspects inherent in the ‘ Digital Education for Teachers ’ course program. A total number of 140 teachers 
have produced digital learning materials  for 93 disciplines and tested them  in the educational environment 
whereby enlarging the curriculum scope.  
 
7. Conclusion 
Digital education for teachers expands the role of educators and largely contributes to a gradual 
transition from traditional forms of interaction with students to the active use of EER in teaching practice. 
Educational diversity and blended learning  impro ve student engagement and agency, while electronic 
educational resources , web-based e -testing knowledge systems and remote access to networks expand 
cooperation and collaboration among students  in vocational education.  
The use of electronic educational resources is  re-engineering vocational education, wherein the 
share of  practical activities in educational experiences is increasing.  The electronic educational resources 
created by teachers meet the urgent needs of students engaged in an independent study of  the theoretical 
material of the course. This in turn affects student motivation in the classroom and  systematizes subject 
knowledge when a student is mastering the core competencies and problem -solving skills. In addition, 
electronic educational resources  are designed as a tool for students to use to develop digital competencies,  
the vital 21st -century skills for students.
