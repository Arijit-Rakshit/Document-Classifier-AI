recognition5What is Hard Computing ?
•Hard computing, i.e., conventional 
compu ting, requires a precise ly  stated 
analytical model and often a lot of 
Computational Time.
•Many analytical models are valid forideal  
cases.
•Real world problems exist in a non-ideal  
environment.6Premises and guiding principles of  
HardComputing
Precision, Certainty, andRigor.
•Many contemporary problems do not lend  
themselves to precise solutions such as: 
Recognition problems (handwriting,  
speech, objects, images, texts)
Mobile robot coordination, forecasting,  
combinatorial problems etc.
Reasoning on natural languages7

objects, images, texts)8

Natural Language ProcessingWha t isArtificial 
Intelligence ?Some Definitions (I)
The exciting new effort tomake  
computers think…
machines with minds,
in the full literal sense.
Haugeland, 1985Some Definitions (II)
The study of mental faculties through the use  
of computational models.
Charniak and McDermott, 1985
A field of study that seeks to explain and  
emulate intelligent behavior in terms of  
computational processes.
Schalkoff , 1990Some Definitions (III)
The study of how to make  
computers dothings atwhich, at  
the moment, people are better.

•Artificial Intelligence
obuildandunderstand intelligent entities oragents
o2 main approaches: ―engineering ‖ versus ―cognitive modeling‖WhatisArtificial  Intelligence?
(John McCarthy, Stanford University)
• W h a t  isartificial intelligence?
Itisthescience and engineering ofmaking intelligent machines, especially intelligent  
computer programs. I t  is related to the similar task of using computers to understand  
human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are  
biologically observable.
•Isn't there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn't depend on 
relating it to human  intelligence?
Not yet. The problem isthat we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of  
computational procedures wewant tocall intelligent. We understand some ofthe  
mechanisms ofintelligence and not others.

•1950 AlanT uring’spaper , ComputingMachin eryand

•Turing predicted that inabout fiftyyears "an average
interrogator willnothave more thana70percent chance of
making the right identification after five minutes of
questioning" .

•Soimag ine anindividual islocked inaroom andgiven a
batch of Chinese writing.
•The person locked inthe room does not understand Chinese .
Next heisgiven more Chinese writing and aset ofrules (in
English which heunderstands) onhow tocollate the first setof
Chinese characters with the second setofChinese characters .
•Suppose the person gets sogood atmanipulating the Chinese
symbols and the rules are sogood, that tothose outside the
room itappears that theperson understands Chinese .
•Searle's point is that, he doesn't really understand Chinese, it
really only following asetofrules.
•Following this argument, acomputer could never be truly
intelligent, itisonly manipulating symbols that itreally doesn't
understand the semantic context .Can these Questions are Answerable?

Can Computers Talk?
•This is known as ―speech synthesis‖
otranslate text to phonetic form
•e.g., ―fictitious‖ ->fik-tish-es
ousepronunciation rulestomapphonemes toactual sound
•e.g., ―tish‖ -> sequence of basic audio sounds
•Difficulties
osounds made bythis―lookup‖ approach sound unnatural
osounds are notindependent
•e.g., ―act‖ and―action‖
•modern systems (e.g., atAT&T) canhandle thispretty well
oaharder problem isemphasis, emotion, etc
•humans understand what theyaresaying
•machines don’t: sotheysound unnatural
•Conclusion:
oNO, for complete sentences
oYES, for individual wordsCan Computers Recognize Speech?
•Speech Recognition:
omapping sounds fromamicrophone intoalistofwords
oclassic problem in AI, very difficult
•Recognizing single words fromasmall vocabulary

(ctd.)
•Recognizing normal speech ismuch more difficult
ospeech iscontinuous: where aretheboundaries between words?
•e.g.,―John’s carhasaflattire‖

otrytelling awaiter inarestaurant:
―Iwould likesome sugar inmycoffee‖
obackground noise, other speakers, accents, colds, etc
oonnormal speech, modern systems areonlyabout 60-70%accurate
•Conclusion:
oNO,normal speech istoocomplex toaccurately recognize
oYES, for restricted problems (small vocabulary, single speaker)CanComputers LearnandAdapt?
•Learning andAdaptation
oconsider acomputer learning todrive onthefreeway
owecould code lotsofrulesabout what todo
oand/or wecould have itlearn fromexperience
omachine learning allows computers tolearn todothings without  
explicit programming
•Conclusion: YES, computers can learn and  
adapt, when presented withinformation inthe  
appropriate wayCan Computers “see”?
•Recognition v. Understanding (likeSpeech)
oRecognition andUnderstanding ofObjects inascene
•look around thisroom
•you caneffortlessly recognize objects
•human brain canmap2dvisual image to3d―map‖
•Why is visual recognition ahard problem?
•Conclusion:
omostly NO:computers canonly―see‖ certain types ofobjects under  
limited circumstances
oYESforcertain constrained problems (e.g., facerecognition)CanComputers planandmake
decisions?
•Intelligence
oinvolves solving problems andmaking decisions andplans
oe.g.,youwant tovisityourcousin inBoston
•youneed todecide ondates, flights
•youneed togettotheairport, etc
•involves asequence ofdecisions, plans, andactions
•What makes planning hard?
othe world is notpredictable:
•yourflightiscanceled orthere’s abackup onthe405
othere isapotentially huge number ofdetails
•doyouconsider allflights? alldates?
o no: commonsense constrains yoursolutions
oAIsystems areonlysuccessful inconstrained planning problems
•Conclusion: NO,real-world planning anddecision -
making is still beyond the capabilities of modern  
computers
oexception: verywell-defined, constrained problems: mission planning for  
satelites.Summary ofStateofAISystems
